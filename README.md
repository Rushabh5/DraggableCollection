# Draggable UICollectionViewCell
In this tutorial, I will cover how to reorder cells in UICollectionView using drag & drop. I have seen many different 
approaches on how to do this, some are working decent and some are not. That's why I will show you the approach that is 
tested and working 100%.

To make this tutorial shorter, I will only present how to do the reordering and won't show all the required delegate methods.
Since you got here, I count that you already know the UICollectionView basics.
